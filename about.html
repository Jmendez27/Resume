      <h2>About me </h2>
      <p class="section"> In 2014 I worked for NYU Langone Medical Center for the admissions department. During my time at NYU I felt like I had learned all I could there and wanted to do something different. I began looking for new opportunities and I had found Fordham Univesrity. Working at Fordham is a great opportunity because it allows to me to attend the School of Professional and Continuing studies. Currently I am working towards a degree in Information Technology and Systems. My goal is to enter the masters program for Cyber sercutiy. I choose this major is because we are living in a digital age and understanding how the programs that enable modern living work is important.

      <p class="section1"> When I applied for a position at Fordham I had done so at Quinn Library and the Gifts and Records department. As part of the interview process for Quinn Library I was asked to create a presentation on changes the library could make.The presentation I created was about the addtion of QR codes across the library could allow for easier student navigation and statistical tracking of sought after resources.</p>
